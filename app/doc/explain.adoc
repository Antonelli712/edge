= How Edge works: A commentary to help understand Edge in order to build upon it

To discover how Edge works, dive into the code in `src`.

The first place to go is
link:/sources/src/edge/system.clj[edge.system]. This is where the
various components of Edge are defined:

* Web Server
* Selmer
* Database

link:/sources/src/edge/httpd.clj[edge.httpd] defines a component called
`WebServer` which listens on a port (3000) and declares the virtual
hosts and bidi route structures.
